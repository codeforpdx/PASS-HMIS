solid-remote-server-compose.yaml && solid-remote-server-config.json are templates for deploying the server remotely. The server URL can be updated as needed, the current setup is for our deployment on opencommons.

The config should be stored as /config/solid-server/solid-config.json and solid-remote-server-compose.yaml stored at the community solid server root.
